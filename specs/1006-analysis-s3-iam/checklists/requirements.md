# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Analysis Lambda S3 IAM Permissions

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass. This is a well-bounded IAM permission fix with:
- Clear root cause (missing s3:HeadObject)
- Specific file location (main.tf lines 274-276)
- Measurable success criteria (403 errors resolved, dashboard shows data)
- Defined assumptions and out-of-scope items

Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
