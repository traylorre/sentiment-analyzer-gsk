# Feature Specification: 105-interview-future-improvements

**Branch**: `105-interview-future-improvements` | **Date**: 2025-12-12

## Problem Statement

The Interview Dashboard has accumulated several improvement ideas from audit and user feedback.
Without a tracking document, these improvements may be lost or forgotten.

## Solution

Create `interview/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` to track:
- Planned UX enhancements (navigation, hover states, animations)
- Functionality additions (web traffic generator, root redirect)
- Polish items (timer, mobile, accessibility)
- Completed improvements with dates

## Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Create tracking document | Implement the improvements |
| Document known issues | CI/CD changes |
| Prioritize improvements | |

## Success Criteria

| SC-002 | Documents all known improvements | Manual review |
| SC-003 | Includes priority levels | Manual review |
