# CodeQL Security Analysis
# ========================
#
# GitHub's semantic code analysis for security vulnerabilities.
# Catches complex issues that simple linters miss.
#
# For On-Call Engineers:
#   If CodeQL finds issues:
#   1. Review in Security tab → Code scanning alerts
#   2. Assess severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
#   3. Fix or dismiss with justification
#   4. Critical issues should block deployment
#
# For Developers:
#   - CodeQL analyzes Python code for security patterns
#   - Results appear in PR checks and Security tab
#   - False positives can be dismissed with comment
