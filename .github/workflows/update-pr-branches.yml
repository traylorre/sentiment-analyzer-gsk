# Auto-update PR branches when workflow files change
# ===================================================
#
# When workflow files are fixed in main, existing PRs still run the
# old workflow from their branch. This workflow automatically updates
# all open PR branches when workflow files change.
#
# For On-Call Engineers:
#   - This workflow runs automatically on workflow file changes
#   - Check job logs to see which PRs were updated/skipped
#   - PRs with merge conflicts are skipped (not an error)
#
# For Developers:
#   - Manual alternative: /poke-stale-prs slash command
#   - PRs skipped due to conflicts need manual rebase
