# CodeQL Configuration
# ====================
#
# Custom configuration to reduce false positives while maintaining security coverage.
#
# For On-Call Engineers:
#   If security alerts are being incorrectly suppressed, review this file.
#   Test exclusions are intentional - test code doesn't handle real URLs.
#
# For Developers:
#   - Production code (src/) is fully scanned
#   - Test code (tests/) has URL sanitization rule excluded (false positives)
#   - All other security rules apply to tests

name: "sentiment-analyzer-codeql-config"

# Exclude test files from URL substring sanitization rule
# These are false positives - test code verifies template substitution, not URL validation
paths-ignore:
  - tests/**/*

# But we still want to scan tests for other issues, so we use query filters instead
query-filters:
  # Exclude py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization from test files only
  # This rule flags test assertions that check URL presence in HTML templates
  - exclude:
      id: py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization
      paths:
        - tests/**
