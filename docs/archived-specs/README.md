|------|--------|--------|
| E-remove-newsapi-dead-code | SUPERSEDED | Replaced by spec 501 (Complete NewsAPI Purge) |
| 038-ecr-docker-build | OBSOLETE | Design predates spec 016 (SSE Lambda) implementation |
| 041-pipeline-blockers | UNCLEAR | No measurable criteria; needs decomposition |
| 051-validation-bypass-audit | AUDIT-ONLY | Findings belong in docs, not implementation spec |
| 057-pragma-comment-stability | TOO-NARROW | Single-line fix; should be ticket, not spec |
| 070-validation-blindspot-audit | AUDIT-ONLY | Overlaps with methodology validators |
| 071-fix-codeql-alerts | SUPERSEDED | Use security validation methodology instead |
| 075-validation-gaps | META-SPEC | Testing meta-spec; needs decomposition |
| 076-v1-test-deprecation | UNCLEAR | Old reference; needs audit before action |
