# Production dependencies for Analysis Lambda (Container Image)
# =============================================================
#
# This file contains ONLY production dependencies needed at runtime.
# Test dependencies (pytest, moto, etc.) are in requirements-dev.txt
#
# Key dependencies:
# - transformers: HuggingFace library for DistilBERT model
# - torch: PyTorch for model inference (CPU-only)
# - boto3: AWS SDK for DynamoDB access
#
# Note: Container images don't need AWS Lambda runtime libraries
# (they're provided by the base image)

# HuggingFace transformers for sentiment analysis model
transformers>=4.30.0,<5.0.0

# PyTorch (CPU-only for Lambda cost optimization)
# Use torch-cpu index for smaller image size
torch>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

# AWS SDK for DynamoDB
boto3>=1.28.0

# boto3 stubs for type hints (optional but helpful)
boto3-stubs[dynamodb]>=1.28.0
